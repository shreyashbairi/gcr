      <h1 class="blog-article__title">Trans-Caspian Route: Growth Metrics Q4 2025</h1>
      <div class="blog-article__body">
        <p>The Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, widely known as the Middle Corridor, has posted record throughput figures for the fourth quarter of 2025, consolidating its position as the fastest-growing trade route connecting China to Europe. According to data released by the Middle Corridor Coordination Committee, total cargo volume for Q4 reached 1.8 million tonnes, a 58 percent increase over the same period in 2024. Container traffic specifically grew by 73 percent, with TEU counts surpassing initial projections by a wide margin and signaling a structural shift in Eurasian trade patterns.</p>

        <p>The growth has been driven by several converging factors. Ongoing disruptions to traditional northern transit routes through Russia have continued to redirect commercial freight toward the Middle Corridor. Simultaneously, significant infrastructure investments at key nodes along the route have begun to yield operational dividends. The expansion of the Port of Kuryk in Kazakhstan, which completed its first phase in mid-2025, has added 5 million tonnes of annual cargo handling capacity. Azerbaijan's Alyat port complex has similarly scaled its operations, with new ro-ro ferry berths reducing Caspian Sea crossing times by an average of 18 hours.</p>

        <h2>Breaking down the Q4 numbers</h2>

        <p>A closer examination of the Q4 data reveals important compositional shifts. While bulk commodities, primarily grain, metals, and petrochemicals, continue to account for the majority of tonnage, the share of containerized manufactured goods has risen from 22 percent to 34 percent year-over-year. This diversification is significant because it indicates that the Middle Corridor is transitioning from a commodity-focused route to a comprehensive trade artery capable of supporting the higher-value, time-sensitive cargo flows that define modern supply chains. Electronics, automotive components, and consumer goods from Chinese manufacturing centers are increasingly using the corridor to reach European markets.</p>

        <blockquote>"The numbers tell a story that goes beyond logistics. When container volumes grow at 73 percent annually, you are witnessing the creation of a new commercial geography. The Middle Corridor is no longer a contingency route; it is becoming the default pathway for a growing share of Eurasian trade." &mdash; Middle Corridor Coordination Committee quarterly report</blockquote>

        <p>Transit times remain a competitive challenge. The average end-to-end journey from Xi'an to Istanbul currently takes 18 to 22 days via the Middle Corridor, compared to 12 to 15 days via the northern route through Russia and 30 to 35 days by sea through the Suez Canal. However, the reliability premium is increasingly favoring the Middle Corridor, as its transit time variance has narrowed to plus or minus two days, significantly better than the unpredictable delays that have plagued both alternatives. For shippers prioritizing supply chain predictability, the Middle Corridor is becoming the rational choice.</p>

        <p>GCR Consulting's logistics advisory team publishes quarterly analysis of Middle Corridor performance metrics, providing clients with the data-driven insights needed to optimize their supply chain strategies. The firm has advised 14 multinational corporations on Middle Corridor integration over the past year, helping them design routing strategies, negotiate carrier contracts, and establish local forwarding partnerships across Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. As volumes continue to scale, the advisory demand around Middle Corridor operations is expected to grow in parallel.</p>
